ðŸ—¨ WASI Monotonic Clock is a clock API intended to let users measure elapsed time.
ðŸ—¨
ðŸ—¨ It is intended to be portable at least between Unix-family platforms and Windows.
ðŸ—¨
ðŸ—¨ A monotonic clock is a clock which has an unspecified initial value, and
ðŸ—¨ successive reads of the clock will produce non-decreasing values.
ðŸ—¨
ðŸ—¨ It is intended for measuring elapsed time.
structure MonotonicClock { }

type Nanoseconds = u64

extends MonotonicClock {
    ðŸ—¨ Read the current value of the clock.
    ðŸ—¨
    ðŸ—¨ The clock is monotonic, therefore calling this function repeatedly will
    ðŸ—¨ produce a sequence of non-decreasing values.
    #ffi("wasi:clocks/wall-clock", "now")
    function now() -> Nanoseconds {

    }

    ðŸ—¨ Query the resolution of the clock. Returns the duration of time
    ðŸ—¨ corresponding to a clock tick.
    #ffi("wasi:clocks/wall-clock", "resolution")
    function resolution() -> Nanoseconds {
